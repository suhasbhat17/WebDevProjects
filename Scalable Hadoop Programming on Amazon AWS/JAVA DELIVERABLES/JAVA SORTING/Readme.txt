CODE FLOW

The program prompts the user to enter the path to the input file. After which the filename to the input file has to be entered. Each line of the file is read iteratively and each words are tokenized. 
Then the Selection sort is performed on it. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
